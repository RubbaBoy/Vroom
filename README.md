# Vroom

Vroom is a project made by myself and [Jacob](https://github.com/jhg023) in Java using LWJGL, which is a 3D game engine. We plan to make a game with it as well, but the engine will be a separate project. This will probably be moved into its own organization when development picks up.

This project heavily utilizes an [LWJGL tutorial](https://ahbejarano.gitbook.io/lwjglgamedev/), whose source code can be found [here](https://github.com/lwjglgamedev/lwjglbook).
